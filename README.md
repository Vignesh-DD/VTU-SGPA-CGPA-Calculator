## Purpose

This project is designed for VTU MCA students (2024 Scheme) to simplify academic grade tracking and planning. Under the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) curriculum, students are graded using credit-based SGPA and CGPA systems, and it's often challenging to:

**Track academic progress semester-wise (SGPA)**

**Calculate cumulative performance (CGPA)**

**Predict the required SGPA in future semesters to achieve a target CGPA**
